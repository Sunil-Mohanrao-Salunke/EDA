## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
require(ggplot2)
data("diamonds")
names(diamonds)
ggplot(aes(x = price, col = cut), data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram()+
  facet_wrap(~color)+
  scale_fill_brewer(type = 'qual')+
  scale_x_log10()
```

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x =table, y = price, col = cut), data = diamonds)+
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_brewer(type = 'qual')
summary(diamonds$table)
```

 Create a scatterplot of diamond price vs.volume (x * y * z) and color the points by the clarity of diamonds. Use scale on the y-axis to take the log10 of price. You should also omit the top 1% of diamond volumes from the plot.

```{r}
diamonds$volume <- diamonds$x * diamonds$y * diamonds$z

ggplot(aes(x = volume, y= price, col = clarity), data =subset( diamonds, volume< 0.9*max(volume))) + 
         geom_point()+
  scale_y_log10()

summary(diamonds$volume)
```
